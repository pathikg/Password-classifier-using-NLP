# Password-classifier-using-NLP
Three models were trained for password strength classification using NLP:
Model               Cross Validation Accuracy
XGBoost             98.58%
Logistic Regression 81.96%
Random Forest       94.33%

Since XGBoost had the best cross validation accuracy, it was selected as the model for this classification task.
